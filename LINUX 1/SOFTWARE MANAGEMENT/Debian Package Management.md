Debian based distributions use the following software management commands
**aptitude**: terminal-based package manager
**apt** Advanced Packaging Tool: dependency resolver
**dpkg**: single package manager
**tasksel**: managing package groups

#### Apt Cache

Installed debian packages are first downloaded and stored in **/var/cache/apt/archives**. The cache can be shared among multiple clients to install already downloaded software. Utilities for this are: apt-cacher, apt-cacher-ng, and apt-proxy

#### Installing and Removing Debian Repositories

/etc/apt/sources.list.d

Learn the codename of the Debian release
$ **lsb_release -sc**

```
root@server15:~# lsb_release -sc
No LSB modules are available.
bookworm
```

Add a Debian repository
\# **add-apt-repository** "deb *URL*" *CODENAME*/*SUITE*  *COMPONENTS*

Remove a repository
\# **apt-get repository -r** ...

When installing or removing repositories, update the package cache
\# **apt update**

To download repository updates and install the upgrades
\# **apt upgrade**

List package dependencies
$ **apt depends** *PACKAGE*

#### Using apt to Search, Inspect, Install and Remove Packages

Search for a package

``` bash
apt search "PACKAGENAME"
```

Limit the search to package names that include the search term

``` bash
apt search "PACKAGE" --names-only
```

Get detailed info on a package

``` bash
apt show "PACKAGE"
```

Install / remove package. Remove does not remove conf files

``` bash
apt install | remove "PACKAGENAME"
```

To remove a package along with conf files

``` bash
apt remove purge "PACKAGENAME"
```

#### Using dpkg to Install, Remove Packages

man dpkg

To install a dpkg package

\# **dpkg -i** *PACKAGENAME*

Remove a package

``` bash
dpkg -r "PACKAGENAME"
```

Remove a package and its conf files

``` bash
dpkg -P | --purge "PACKAGENAME"
```

##### Using dpkg to Query and Inspect Packages

dpkg can query installed packages or .deb files. When querying installed packages only the name of the package is used as in "fdisk". When querying a .deb file, the full file path of the package is provided ./fdisk_2.38.1-5+deb12u1_amd64.deb

``` bash
dpkg-query [OPTION] [PACKAGE.deb]
```

List all dpkg-query commands

```
dpkg-query --help
```

List all installed packages

``` bash
dpkg -l | --list
```

```

Statuses
* Desired

* Error

Status codes:
ii - Package is installed and will install updates if available
hi - package is on hold and installed but will not install updates
un - package is not installed
rc - package is not installed, but there are leftover conf files. (Usually after uninstalling)

List the contents of an installed package

``` bash
dpkg -L | --listfiles "PACKAGENAME"
```

List the contents of a .deb package file

``` bash
dpkg -c | --contents "PACKAGE.deb"
```

Get info about a deb package file

``` bash
dpkg -I "PACKAGE.deb"
```

Get info about an installed package

``` bash
dpkg -p "PACKAGENAME"
```

Find which package an installed file belongs to (what provides)

``` bash
dpkg -S | --search "PATH_TO_FILE"
```
#### Using tasksel

**tasksel** manages tasks (debian package groups)

To list available tasks (groups)

``` bash
tasksel --list-tasks
```

Install / remove a task

``` bash
tasksel install | remove  "TASK"
```

#### Compiling from source

1. Configure the application
2. Compile or make the application
3. Install the application

Download the app source. In this case nginx

``` bash
wget -c http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.10.1.tar.gz
```

-c: resume the download if network interrupted from where it left off

Extract the compressed archive 

``` bash
tar -zxvf nginx-1.10.1.tar.gz
```
#### Configure the Application

[Info about the make command]( http://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/why_makefile.htm f)

Install the required dependecies:

``` bash
apt intall -y zlib1g-dev libpcre3-dev
```

``` bash
cd nginx-1.10.1
./configure --help
```

Create a /opt/nginx dir and a system user nginx

Configure the installer

``` bash
./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx --user=nginx --group=nginx
```

The configuration command writes a configuration header and a special file **Makefile** which contains commands needed to build the software by the **make** command

Execute the make command to compile the app then the make install command

``` bash
make [-j"CPU_CORES"] # for parallel computing
make install
```

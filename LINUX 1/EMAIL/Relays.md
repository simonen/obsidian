Using a **mail relay server** can be beneficial in various scenarios. Here are some common cases where a relay server is often used:

#### 1. **Outbound Email Traffic Control (Smart Host)**

- **Scenario:** If you have multiple internal mail servers (e.g., for different departments or applications) and want to consolidate outbound email through one central server.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - Simplifies email management and monitoring by having a single point of egress.
    - Controls outbound mail policies, such as rate-limiting or spam filtering, at one server.
    - Ensures emails are delivered through a trusted server, reducing the likelihood of them being marked as spam.

#### 2. **Sending Email from Dynamic IP Addresses or Home Networks**

- **Scenario:** You want to send email from a device or server with a **dynamic IP address**, often associated with home networks or small businesses.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - Many ISPs block port 25 (SMTP) traffic for outgoing emails from dynamic IP addresses.
    - Emails sent directly from a dynamic IP are often flagged as spam by receiving mail servers. Using a relay with a **static, trusted IP address** (or a service like Gmail, SendGrid, or Amazon SES) avoids this.
    - Relay hosts usually have a better reputation, ensuring email deliverability.

#### 3. **Centralized Spam Filtering and Email Security**

- **Scenario:** You want all outgoing and incoming email to be processed through a **spam filter**, **virus scanner**, or **data loss prevention** (DLP) tool before it reaches the final mail server.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - Ensures that all emails (from various servers or users) are uniformly checked for threats or spam.
    - Relays can be configured to block or quarantine emails that don’t meet security standards.

#### 4. **Load Balancing and Redundancy**

- **Scenario:** If you're handling a large volume of email, a single mail server might not be sufficient to handle the load, or you may want to provide redundancy.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - Distributes email sending across multiple servers, balancing the load and improving performance.
    - Can provide high availability if one relay server goes down—other relay servers can take over, ensuring continuous email flow.

#### 5. **Corporate Policies and Auditing**

- **Scenario:** A company wants to apply email policies such as archiving all outgoing email or enforcing disclaimers/signatures.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - You can enforce email compliance, logging, and auditing from a central point.
    - Relays allow you to easily capture and archive all email traffic for legal or regulatory compliance.

#### 6. **Internal-to-External Communication**

- **Scenario:** Your internal mail servers (within a company) need to send email externally but are not directly exposed to the public internet.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - A relay server located in the DMZ can handle public email delivery, while internal servers remain isolated from the outside world, improving security.
    - Reduces the attack surface by only exposing one mail relay server to external traffic.

#### 7. **Cloud Applications and Services**

- **Scenario:** You have applications or services hosted in the cloud (AWS, Azure, etc.) that need to send emails.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - Cloud providers’ IP ranges may get blocked by receiving mail servers due to abuse or spam. A trusted relay can ensure these emails are accepted by recipients.
    - It simplifies email delivery for cloud services that don’t have built-in mail capabilities.

#### 8. **Email Authentication and Reputation**

- **Scenario:** You want to ensure outgoing email complies with authentication protocols like **SPF**, **DKIM**, or **DMARC** to improve deliverability.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - A relay can handle signing outgoing emails and ensure they pass SPF/DKIM checks.
    - Improves your domain’s reputation by controlling email flow and ensuring it meets best practices.

#### 9. **Email Service Providers (ESPs) and Bulk Mail Senders**

- **Scenario:** You send bulk or transactional email (such as newsletters or automated emails).
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - ESPs like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or Postmark use specialized relays optimized for high-volume sending and deliverability.
    - These relays can handle the complex task of managing feedback loops, unsubscribe requests, and bounce management for large-scale campaigns.

#### 10. **Hosted or Managed Mail Services**

- **Scenario:** Your organization uses hosted or managed email services (e.g., Gmail or Microsoft 365), and you need a reliable way to send email from internal systems.
- **Why Use a Relay?**
    - Cloud-based services often limit outgoing email from their IP ranges. A relay server can handle outbound traffic for internal services that don't have their own mail-sending capabilities.
    - Some cloud providers restrict or block SMTP traffic (port 25), so relays offer a solution.

### Key Benefits of Using a Mail Relay

- **Better Deliverability:** Helps prevent emails from being marked as spam by using a trusted server.
- **Security:** Adds a layer of security by filtering and monitoring outgoing emails.
- **Centralized Management:** Simplifies the management of email for large organizations or infrastructures.
- **Compliance:** Enforces corporate or legal email policies (e.g., archiving, filtering).

In summary, using a relay is essential when you want to improve control, security, or deliverability of emails sent from multiple or distributed systems.

Here is an example of a mail transfer MTA1 -> MTA2(open relay) -> MTA3


MTA1 (smtp.6circlescc) sends email to kimchen@york.cc. The message goes to MTA2 (relay)

```
mtp postfix/pipe[22272]: A9775304A3A7: to=<kimchen@york.cc>, relay=spamassassin, delay=14, delays=14/0.02/0/0.15, dsn=2.0.0, stat                                                 us=sent (delivered via spamassassin service)
smtp postfix/qmgr[6725]: A9775304A3A7: removed
smtp postfix/pickup[20944]: 7C7DC304A3A9: uid=997 from=<zibiten@york.cc>
smtp postfix/cleanup[22266]: 7C7DC304A3A9: message-id=<20240923A9@smtp.6circles.cc>
smtp postfix/qmgr[6725]: 7C7DC304A3A9: from=<zibiten@york.cc>, size=824, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
smtp postfix/smtp[22277]: 7C7DC304A3A9: to=<kimchen@york.cc>, relay=mail.ohio.cc[192.168.137.9]:25, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 26B1C3166C08)
smtp postfix/qmgr[6725]: 7C7DC304A3A9: removed

```

MTA2 (mail.ohio.cc) receives mail from MTA1. MTA2 is responsible for the york.cc domain, performs a DNS query for the MX record of york.cc and relays it to MTA3. OPEN RELAY

```
mail postfix/smtpd[6129]: connect from smtp.6circles.cc[192.168.137.2]
mail postfix/smtpd[6129]: 26B1C3166C08: client=smtp.6circles.cc[192.168.137.2]
mail postfix/cleanup[6132]: 26B1C3166C08: message-id=<20240304A3A9@smtp.6circles.cc>
mail postfix/smtpd[6129]: disconnect from smtp.6circles.cc[192.168.137.2] ehlo=2 starttls=1 mail=1 rcpt=1 data=1 quit=1 commands=7
mail postfix/qmgr[4642]: 26B1C3166C08: from=<zibiten@york.cc>, size=1012, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
mail postfix/smtp[6133]: 26B1C3166C08: to=<kimchen@york.cc>, relay=mail.york.cc[192.168.137.5]:25, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 50C9110A3824)
mail postfix/qmgr[4642]: 26B1C3166C08: removed
```

MTA3 (mail.york.cc) gets the messages from MTA2. Final destination

```
mail postfix/smtpd[4708]: connect from mail.ohio.cc[192.168.137.9]
mail postfix/smtpd[4708]: 50C9110A3824: client=mail.ohio.cc[192.168.137.9]
mail postfix/cleanup[4772]: 50C9110A3824: message-id=<202409204A3A9@smtp.6circles.cc>
mail postfix/qmgr[4699]: 50C9110A3824: from=<zibiten@york.cc>, size=1192, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
mail postfix/smtpd[4708]: disconnect from mail.ohio.cc[192.168.137.9] ehlo=2 starttls=1 mail=1 rcpt=1 data=1 quit=1 commands=7
mail postfix/local[4773]: 50C9110A3824: to=<kimchen@york.cc>, relay=local, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (delivered to mailbox)
mail postfix/qmgr[4699]: 50C9110A3824: removed

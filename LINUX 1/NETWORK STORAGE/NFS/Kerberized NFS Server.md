Add the **sec**=*method* option on an export

Security methods:
* **none** : Anonymous access based on the **nobody** permissions. Used with **nfsd_anon_write** boolean. Insecure
* **sys**: Default security method. Access is based on **UID** and **GUID**. Incoming user UID is mapped to the same UID on the server, even if names do not match.
* **krb5**: NFS clients prove their identity with a kerberos keytab file. The authentication session must be kerberized as well. **kinit** *username*
* **krb5i**: more secure krb5. Data in the request is guaranteed not be tampered with
* **krb5p**: same as krb5i, adds encryption between server and client. Best security, impact on speed.

To establish kerberized session between NFS client and host:
* **/etc/krb5.keytab**: contains the security principals for the NFS server and client.
	* **klist -k**: to verify the contents of the **krb5.keytab** file
* **kerberized user session**: 
* **sec**=*method*: both in the share definition and mount option
* **nfs-secure-server.service**: must be active on the server
* **nfs-secure.service**: must be active on the client

The ipa domain should be resolved by the IPA server. To confirm that use the dig cmd:
\# **dig** example.com

```

Create the service principal of the **NFS** server **on the IPA server**:
**\# ipa service-add** nfs/nfsserver.example.com --force (if DNS error about A record )

On the NFS server:
**\# kinit -k**
\# **ipa-getkeytab -s** *ipa.example.com* **-k /etc/krb5.keytab** -p nfs/nfsserver.example.com

In the **/etc/exports** file:
/*SHARE* *HOSTS*(**sec=krb5, rw**)
Change exported dir ownership
**\# exportfs -rv**

On the NFS client:
\# **kinit -k**
**\# ipa-getkeytab -s** *ipa.example.com* **-k /etc/krb5.keytab** -p host/host.example.com

The **rpc-gssd.service** (nfs-secure.service) should be running
\# **systemctl enable** --now **nfs-secure**
**\# mount -o sec=krb5** *NFSSERVER_FQDN:/EXPORT* /*MOUNTPOINT*
